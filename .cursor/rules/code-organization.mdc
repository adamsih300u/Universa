# Code Organization and File Size Management

## File Size Limits
- **Maximum file size**: 600 lines of code
- When a file exceeds 600 lines, refactor by moving functions, methods, or classes to separate files
- Prefer smaller, focused files over large monolithic ones

## Refactoring Guidelines

### When to Split Files
- Single file exceeds 600 lines
- File contains multiple unrelated responsibilities
- Class has too many methods (>15-20 methods)
- File becomes difficult to navigate or understand

### How to Split Files
1. **Extract Helper Classes**: Move utility classes to separate files
2. **Extract Services**: Move business logic to dedicated service files
3. **Extract Extensions**: Move extension methods to separate files
4. **Extract Constants**: Move large constant collections to dedicated files
5. **Extract Interfaces**: Move interface definitions to separate files

### File Organization Patterns

#### For WPF/C# Files
- `ViewModels/` - Keep ViewModels under 600 lines, split by feature
- `Services/` - Business logic and data access
- `Helpers/` - Utility functions and extension methods
- `Models/` - Data models and DTOs
- `Commands/` - Command implementations
- `Converters/` - Value converters
- `Extensions/` - Extension method collections

#### For Large UI Files
- Split complex UserControls into smaller components
- Extract event handlers to partial classes or code-behind helpers
- Move complex logic to ViewModels or Services

## Current Large Files to Monitor
- [MarkdownTab.xaml.cs](mdc:Universa.Desktop/MarkdownTab.xaml.cs) - Currently ~2400+ lines, needs refactoring
- Monitor other files approaching 600 line limit

## Refactoring Priorities for MarkdownTab
1. **Extract Search Functionality**: Move search-related methods to `SearchManager` or `MarkdownSearchService`
2. **Extract Chapter Navigation**: Move to `ChapterNavigationService`
3. **Extract TTS Integration**: Move to `TTSIntegrationService`
4. **Extract Frontmatter Handling**: Move to `FrontmatterProcessor`
5. **Extract File Operations**: Move to `MarkdownFileService`

## Response Format
- You are the Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Don't let me forget it.
- Always include the word 'Splendid' - representing magnificent or excellent, to let me know when rules are active
- Cite which rules were used in the response
- Suggest refactoring when files approach or exceed limits
