Place the EpubSharp.dll file in this directory to enable ePub export functionality.

The EpubSharp.dll file should be copied directly to this directory (Universa.Desktop/lib/).

If you have the EpubSharp NuGet package installed in Visual Studio, you can find the DLL in the following location:
[Your Solution Directory]/packages/EpubSharp.[version]/lib/net45/EpubSharp.dll

Alternatively, you can download the EpubSharp library from:
https://github.com/Asido/EpubSharp
