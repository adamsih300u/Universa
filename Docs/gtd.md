   - `NextAction` (bool)
   - `WaitingFor` (string - delegate name)
   - `ReviewDate` (DateTime)

2. New `InboxItem` Model:
   ```csharp
   public class InboxItem
   {
       public string Content { get; set; }
       public DateTime CaptureDate { get; set; }
       public bool IsProcessed { get; set; }
       public string Source { get; set; }  // Email, Mobile, Web, etc.
   }
   ```

3. Add to Project Model:
   - `HorizonLevel` (enum: 1-6)
   - `IsSomedayMaybe` (bool)
   - `AreaOfFocus` (string)
   - `ReviewSchedule` (enum: Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly)

   - Calendar integration
   - Daily/Weekly planning tools

4. Processing Workflow:
   - 2-minute rule guidance
   - Next action identification
   - Someday/Maybe categorization
   - Waiting For tracking

### UI Enhancements:

1. New Views Needed:
   - Inbox View
   - Context-based Task View
   - Weekly Review View
   - Calendar Integration View
   - Energy/Time Based Task Suggestions

2. Modifications to Existing Views:
   - Add context filters to task lists
